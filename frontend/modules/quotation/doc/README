'Quotation' Achievo module usage instructions
=============================================

1. What is it?
--------------
The 'quotation' module is a module for keeping track of quotations. It is a 
helpful tool for the sales department to track progress on outstanding 
quotations. The module can remind people of quotations that are about to
expire or have already expired.

The module also generates unique quotation numbers based on the date and a
sequence number.

The lifecycle of a quotation contains the following states:

Undelivered - this is the initial status after the quotation has been created.
Delivered   - the quotation has been delivered to the customer.
Called      - if after a while no response was received, the owner is supposed
              to call the customer. If the customer indicates that he has not
              yet decided, the status can be set to 'called' so everybody
              knows that the call has been made but no decision has been made.
Accepted    - The customer has accepted the quotation.
Rejected    - The customer has rejected the quotation.
Completed   - The order was completed, the work has been done, and a bill can
              be sent.
Billed      - The bill has been sent.

Depending on the status of a quotation, the screen provides links for moving
to a different status. 

There are 2 possible end-states: Billed or Rejected. A quotation with one of
these statusses is removed from the list.
              

2. Assumptions
--------------
1) You should have activated the quotation module in Achievo. See the 
   doc/INSTALL file for instructions on how to install and activate the 
   module.

   to quotations. Use the profile editor in the Employee menu to accomplish
   this.  
  
   
3. Instructions
---------------
3.1 Managing quotations.

  The quotation management screens are quite self explanatory. Keep in mind
  the quotation lifecycle as described above, and the rest will explain
  itself. Questions may be posted on the Achievo mailinglist, to which you
  can subscribe by sending an empty message to achievo-subscribe@achievo.org.
      
3.2 Sending reminders.

  The module includes a script which can sent reminders for quotations that
  are about to expire. See the doc/INSTALL file for instructions on how to 
  install this script using cron.
  
3.3 Deactivate the "automatically add project" function

  Default when accepting a quotation the project add screen apears with the 
  title of the quotation as projectname. This can be deactivated by inserting 
  the following line in config.inc.php: $config_quotation_addproject = false;
