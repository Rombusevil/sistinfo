Unmaintained language files
===========================

The language files in the unmaintained directory are language files from 
previous Achievo versions that are no longer updated by their translators.

If you want to update one of the unmaintained languages, use en.lng 
from the languages directory as basis for your new translation.
Please also translate the corresponding language file in the atk/languages 
directory. For more information see also:
http://www.achievo.org/wiki/Achievo_HOWTO_Languages

Please send your updated translation to translations@achievo.org so we can include
it in the next release.
