Getting involved
----------------
Achievo is developed in an Open Source (http://www.opensource.org) fashion in
order to facilitate collaboration on the project. One of the reasons for
choosing the Open Source method is to ensure that development is not limited
by our own resources alone.

We can also use some help in doing translations of the software and
documentation writing. If you're creative, we can also use themes. If you
want to help development, post a message on our development forums at
http://www.achievo.org/forum. If you don't want to post in public forums you
can also send an email to sandy@achievo.org with your suggestions.


User documentation
------------------
There's a Guided Tour available on http://www.achievo.org/wiki/Guided_Tour
It covers the most important features of Achievo, and will show you step by
step how to use them.

If you have any questions not covered by the guided tour, post your questions
on the Achievo forums at http://www.achievo.org/forum.
